## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Sass preprocessor
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Custom webpack

### What I learned

I really focused on implementing Sass for this project, as well as creating a custom webpack. I have prior experience with Sass, but none with webpack. I learned how to create a custom webpack configuration, as well as the differences between dev and production environments.

The checkbox CSS "hack" was necessary to complete this challenge, and I was able to master it as well as the :before and :after CSS pseudo-elements.

### Continued development

I failed to do this project with a mobile-first design, and I felt the pain of it later on. I need to emphasize the necessity of mobile-first design.

### Useful resources

- (https://css-tricks.com/almanac/selectors/a/after-and-before/) - This helped me a ton with understanding what exactly :before and :after did, and how to utilize those pseudo-elements.
- (https://codepen.io/Qvcool/pen/bdzVYW) - I was able to review this code and play around with it to see exactly what properties controlled each aspect of the toggler.
- (https://dev.to/christo_pr/create-a-nice-looking-input-range-with-only-css-4oa2) - This article got me started with the range input element. I had no idea that there were shadow DOM elements on the range input, and that allowed me to figure out how to target these elements for styling purposes.
